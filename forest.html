				<p>The Amazon rainforest, covering much of northwestern Brazil and extending into Colombia, Peru and other South American countries, is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, famed for its biodiversity. It’s crisscrossed by thousands of rivers, including the powerful Amazon. 
River towns, with 19th-century architecture from rubber-boom days, 
include Brazil’s Manaus and Belém and Peru’s Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado.<p>


<p>
Contrary to Hollywood depictions of the Amazon rainforest, most animals do not go out of their way to hunt down humans. However, the rainforest is brimming with creatures that will attack in self defense.
In addition, the rainforest houses numerous species of small, venomous creatures like snakes and frogs.</p>


<p>Rainforests are bursting with life. Not only do millions of species of plants and animals live in rainforests, but people also call the rainforest their home. In fact, 
indigenous, or native, peoples have lived in rainforests for many thousands of years.</p>
